Re-Analysis of the RXTE and RHESSI data of the 2004 Giant Flare from SGR 1906-20
=================================================================================

This repository contains all code and basic data to reproduce the results and
figures from Huppenkothen, Watts + Levin (submitted to ApJ). 

You can find the repository at its `github address <https://github.com/dhuppenkothen/giantflare-paper/>`_.
Use ::
git clone git@github.com:dhuppenkothen/giantflare-paper.git

to clone the repository to your local disc, or set up your ssh client.

It's still in the process of being cleaned up, so don't be surprised if things
don't *quite* work yet. Over the summer, the code will become a lot  more transparent,
and intermediate data products will appear in a yet to be specified online location.

Requirements 
============

The code requires 
* python 2.7 or later (should be python 3 compliant, but I haven't tested it
* `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_
* `scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`_
* `matplotlib <http://www.matplotlib.org>`_

The code is just a bunch of scripts, so no install instructions are provided.
